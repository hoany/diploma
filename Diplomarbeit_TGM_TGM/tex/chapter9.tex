The goal of the project NAVAR was to implement an Augmented Reality application (app) for our partner 4relation Consulting GmbH. The application is a proof of concept that it is possible to integrate mobile AR applications into modern ERP systems. 4relation Consulting GmbH is going to use our app as a showcase for their customers.
\newline
All three modules of our app were implemented successfully. These modules are car tracking, streaming and design. Each module has its own challenges and difficulties which have been solved. The logic implementation of car tracking is one of the biggest problems. Another issue is accessing the NAV Server with a mobile phone. Both challenges have been solved.

In conclusion our partner is completly satisfied with our AR application.
