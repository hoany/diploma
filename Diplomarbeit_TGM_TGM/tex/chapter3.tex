\section{Andorid SDK Eclipse}

Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) mostly written in Java developed by the Eclipse Foundation.

Eclipse can be used as development environment for almost every common programming language. 

\subsection{Eclipse Workbench}
The Eclipse GUI contains four different sections as one can see in the figure bellow

\begin{enumerate}
\item Overview of all Project inside the workspace
\item Text-editor with functions like: syntax-highlighting, auto-complete, source-generation.
\item The outline contains attributes, methods and classes of the selected file inside the editor. 
\item The last sections shows the console-output     
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Android SDK}
Their is an Android ADT (Adnroid Development Tools) plug-in available for Eclipse. ADT makes it easy to set up new Android projects, create an application UI, add packages based on the Android Framework API, debug applications using the Android SDK tools, and export signed .apk files in order to distribute  applications.

\section{JetBrains WebStorm}
The applications logic had to be created with a programming language called JavaScript. Because of that, the project group had to find a development environment that's best suited for this language. JetBrains WebStorm 7.0.3 was best fit for all future tasks and should be the environment in which JavaScript had been developed. 
\\

However, not only JavaScript, but also HTML as well as CSS could be developed with this IDE. All information about this product can be found on Jet Brains homepage.\cite{webstorm}
\subsection{Overview}
JetBrains WebStorm is a professional JavaScript IDE that supports a wide range of modern technologies related to JavaScript programming language, HTML and  CSS, and provides the complete experience for productive Web development.
\\

WebStorm offers developers an intelligent code editor that truly supports the structure of code written in JavaScript, HTML or CSS, as well as their modern  successors. It features the best-of-breed coding assistance for a whole set of  cutting-edge web technologies, including code completion, refactorings, code formatting, on-the-fly error prevention, and much more. 
\\

WebStorm is also great for developing Node.js applications. Together with integrated instruments 
for testing, debugging and code analysis and integration with various VCS, WebStorm is an essential tool for powerful and productive web development.
