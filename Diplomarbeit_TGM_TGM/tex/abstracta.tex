\chapter*{Abstract}

Augmented reality is a future oriented technology which enhances natural visual perception with additional digital information. The potential benefits of this technology seem nearly overwhelming. Some obvious examples can be found in the areas of video gaming, design and the health-care business. Even if AR is a comparatively young technology there are already wildly spread implementations in different fields.          
\\

The purpose of our presented diploma thesis is to describe the usage of this technology in an Android mobile application. The project of developing the app was accomplished in cooperation with our partner 4relation Consulting GmbH. Our partner recommended to use the Metaio SDK as AR-technology platform. Metaio is the worldwide leader in Augmented Reality research and technology with over 80 000 professional users.

The main function of the mobile application is to track cars (tracking is the process of recognizing objects with a camera). After the successful recognition the user is able to view diverse information of the automobile. Identified cars are presented with additional information provided by an NAV ERP system which is connected online with the Android application. These information get loaded from a NAV database in which they are stored. 4realtion GmbH has decided to use our development as a proof of concept for including mobile applications into modern ERP systems like MS Dynamics-NAV as a showcase for their customers.
