\chapter{Future enhancements and possibilities} \label{chapter:Future enhancement and possibilities}

The developed application can provide several possibilites for the future.
\subsection{Support for iOS and Windows phones/tablets }
The idea of the design of the application was to program platform independent as possible. The only platform dependent code is the code to access the Metaio SDK via Java. So it is possible to simply swap out the Java code with c code for the iOs operation system. It would be the same on Windows phones, however Metaio currently stopped developing the Metaio SDK for windows phones.
\subsection{Other market segments}    
The application was developed for the main purpose to display information from tracked cars.However the same code structure can be implied for several other market segments.For instance you could make a application which tracks food from a supermarket shelf and displays information about the product. Such as the name,nutrient content, price and custom offers.Another scenario could be shopping malls. In this approach the application could track clothes or toys and display information about them. These are just two examples to show the possibilities but there a lot more of them.
