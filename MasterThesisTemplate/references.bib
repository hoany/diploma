	most innovative technologies for the development of distributed software
	systems. While not yet a mainstream approach in software engineering
	at large, a lot of work on agent technology has been done, many research
	results and applications have been presented, and some software products
	exists which have moved from the research community to the industrial
	community. One of these is JADE, a software framework that facilitates
	development of interoperable intelligent multi-agent systems and
	that is distributed under an Open Source License. JADE is a very
	mature product, used by a heterogeneous community of users both in
	research activities and in industrial applications. This paper presents
	JADE and its technological components together with a discussion
	of the possible reasons for its success and lessons learned from
	the somewhat detached perspective possible nine years after its inception.},

	to its environment as well as to its underlying software parts. The
	ontology is used to represent a specification of an agent's domain

	in dem ein oder mehrere Wissenschaftler das Ergebnis seiner oder
	ihrer eigenständigen Forschung darstellt. Wissenschaftliche Arbeiten
	entstehen im Allgemeinen an Hochschulen oder anderen, auch privaten,
	Forschungseinrichtungen und werden von Studenten, Doktoranden oder
	anderen Forschern verfasst. Dies ist jedoch kein zwingendes Merkmal.
	Vor wissenschaftlichen Konferenzen wird in einem call for papers
	zum Einreichen wissenschaftlicher Arbeiten aufgefordert.},
