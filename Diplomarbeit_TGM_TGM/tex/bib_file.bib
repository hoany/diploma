  Abstract                 = {Since a number of years agent technology is considered one of the most innovative technologies for the development of distributed software systems. While not yet a mainstream approach in software engineering at large, a lot of work on agent technology has been done, many research results and applications have been presented, and some software products exists which have moved from the research community to the industrial community. One of these is JADE, a software framework that facilitates development of interoperable intelligent multi-agent systems and that is distributed under an Open Source License. JADE is a very mature product, used by a heterogeneous community of users both in research activities and in industrial applications. This paper presents JADE and its technological components together with a discussion of the possible reasons for its success and lessons learned from the somewhat detached perspective possible nine years after its inception.},

Considering the disassembly as a vital and prospective industry domain, we use the mobile robots to automate the disassembly process. In our system, each mobile robot has particular skills and is supervised by an agent with related objectives and knowledge. An agent has an ontology-based world model, which is responsible to maintain the knowledge about the robot's activities in relation to its environment as well as to its underlying software parts. The ontology is used to represent a specification of an agent's domain knowledge. The system functionality is tested with three mobile robots having a task to disassembly a particular Lego construct.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a particular model of heuristic search as a path-finding problem in a directed graph. A class of graph-searching procedures is described which uses a heuristic function to guide search. Heuristic functions are estimates of the number of edges that remain to be traversed in reaching a goal node. A number of theoretical results for this model, and the intuition for these results, are presented. They relate the efficiency of search to the accuracy of the heuristic function. The results also explore efficiency as a consequence of the reliance or weight placed on the heuristics used.},

  Abstract                 = {Eine wissenschaftliche Arbeit ist ein systematisch gegliederter Text, in dem ein oder mehrere Wissenschaftler das Ergebnis seiner oder ihrer eigenständigen Forschung darstellt. Wissenschaftliche Arbeiten entstehen im Allgemeinen an Hochschulen oder anderen, auch privaten, Forschungseinrichtungen und werden von Studenten, Doktoranden oder anderen Forschern verfasst. Dies ist jedoch kein zwingendes Merkmal. Vor wissenschaftlichen Konferenzen wird in einem call for papers zum Einreichen wissenschaftlicher Arbeiten aufgefordert.},
