The application's logic had to be created with a programming language called JavaScript. Because of that, the project group had to find a development environment that's best suited for this language. JetBrains WebStorm 7.0.3 was best fit for all future tasks and should be the environment in which JavaScript had been developed. 
\\

However, not only JavaScript, but also HTML as well as CSS could be developed with this IDE. All information about this product can be found on Jet Brains homepage.\cite{webstorm}
\subsection{Overview}
JetBrains WebStorm is a professional JavaScript IDE that supports a wide range of modern technologies related to JavaScript programming language, HTML and  CSS, and provides the complete experience for productive Web development.
\\

WebStorm offers developers an intelligent code editor that truly supports the structure of code written in JavaScript, HTML or CSS, as well as their modern  successors. It features the best-of-breed coding assistance for a whole set of  cutting-edge web technologies, including code completion, refactorings, code formatting, on-the-fly error prevention, and much more. 
\\

WebStorm is also great for developing Node.js applications. Together with integrated instruments 
for testing, debugging and code analysis and integration with various VCS, WebStorm is an essential tool for powerful and productive web development.
